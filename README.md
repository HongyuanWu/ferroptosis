Timeline: 

* 2020/01/09: SLC7A11, SAT2 and NCOA4 are quite interesting to be validated in the further study.
* 2020/01/09: updated meta-dge and meta-os script and to merge them to identifiy the best candidate
* CRSIP-CAS9 data indicate TFRC, TAX1BP1 and NCOA4 are in a single-line cascade pathway ([co-dependency>0.25](https://depmap.org/portal/gene/NCOA4?tab=overview))
* KEGG: https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa04216
* Why NCOA4 have low expression level in cancer tissues? TFBS (hg19, [chr10:51,562,558-51,575,632](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr10%3A51562558%2D51575632&hgsid=784503273_i4zeVf5lpUder4efba81vRGY4FUC))?
* NCOA4 gene encodes a 70 kDa protein that functions as a coactivator of PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) and AR (androgen receptor) (Yeh and Chang 1996; Heinlein et al. 1999). The ectopic overexpression of NCOA4 in prostate cancer cells reduces cell proliferation and NCOA4 expression is reduced in aggressive prostate and breast cancers, thus suggesting that this gene may function as a suppressor of tumorigenesis (Kollara et al. 2001; Li et al. 2002; Ligr et al. 2010).
* 2019/09/09: generate the idea to identify ferroptosis related cancer therapy drug targets.
